### 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH (4 minutes)

#### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing
**Text Cleaning Pipeline:**
```
Raw Text → Lowercase → Remove URLs/HTML
         → Remove Emojis → Remove Punctuation
         → Remove Numbers → Remove Stopwords
         → Lemmatization → Clean Text
```

**Live Demo:**
```python
Original: "This phone is AMAZING! 😊 Best camera quality. https://example.com"
Cleaned: "phone amazing best camera quality"
```

#### Phase 2: Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- 5,000 features (unigrams + bigrams)
- Captures word importance across documents

#### Phase 3: Model Training
**Three Models Compared:**

| Model | Type | Strength |
|-------|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | Linear | Fast, interpretable |
| Naive Bayes | Probabilistic | Very fast, baseline |
| SVM | Kernel-based | Highest accuracy |

## 🎯 Q&A PREPARATION

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you choose these specific models?**
> "I selected three diverse algorithms to compare different approaches: Logistic Regression for interpretability, Naive Bayes for speed, and SVM for maximum accuracy. This comparison shows the trade-offs between performance and computational cost."

**Q: How does TF-IDF work?**
> "TF-IDF measures word importance by balancing term frequency (how often a word appears) with inverse document frequency (how unique the word is). This helps identify truly meaningful words while reducing the weight of common words."

**Q: What if the model encounters new slang or emojis?**
> "The current model removes emojis and may not handle new slang well. For production, I would implement continuous learning to update the vocabulary and potentially use pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT that capture semantic meaning."

**Q: How would you deploy this to production?**
> "I would containerize the application with Docker, set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, deploy to AWS/GCP using Kubernetes, implement API rate limiting, add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, and set up A/B testing for model updates."

**Q: What about data privacy and security?**
> "For production, I would implement data anonymization, secure API endpoints with authentication, encrypt data in transit and at rest, comply with GDPR/CCPA regulations, and implement audit logging."

**Q: Can this handle other product categories?**
> "Yes, the model is domain-agnostic. While trained on mobile phone reviews, it can generalize to other product categories. For optimal performance in a new domain, I'd recommend fine-tuning with domain-specific data."

**Q: What's your model update strategy?**
> "I would implement continuous monitoring of model performance, set up automated retraining pipelines when accuracy drops below threshold, maintain model versioning, use A/B testing for new models, and keep a fallback to the previous version."

**Q: How do you handle multilingual reviews?**
> "Currently, the model is English-only. For multilingual support, I would implement language detection, use language-specific preprocessing, leverage multilingual BERT models, or train separate models per language."
