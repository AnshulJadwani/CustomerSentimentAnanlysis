Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of the Customer Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews project, perfect for a capstone in AI & Data Science:

‚úÖ Project Title:

Customer Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Product Reviews

‚úÖ Area/Domain:

Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis, Data Science, E-Commerce

‚úÖ Brief Project Description:

This project aims to automatically classify customer reviews from e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze the text data. This helps businesses understand customer satisfaction, improve product quality, and make data-driven marketing decisions.

üîç Detailed Explanation:
üß† Problem Statement:

Customers leave thousands of text reviews on e-commerce platforms. Manually analyzing these reviews is time-consuming. An automated system can extract insights like:

What users love/hate about a product?

What common issues are faced?

How customer sentiment changes over time?

üîß Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Libraries: NLTK / spaCy, Scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Deep Learning (optional): LSTM, BERT

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly

Dataset: Amazon product reviews (from Kaggle or other public sources)

üõ† Project Workflow:

Data Collection

Download datasets of product reviews from Amazon, Flipkart, etc.

Data includes reviewText, rating, and possibly reviewTitle.

Data Preprocessing

Clean the text (remove punctuation, stop words, URLs)

Tokenization & Lemmatization

Convert star ratings to sentiment labels:

Ratings 1-2 ‚Üí Negative

Rating 3 ‚Üí Neutral

Ratings 4-5 ‚Üí Positive

Feature Extraction

Convert text to numerical vectors using:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe/BERT)

Model Training

Train classification models:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (for simple implementation)

LSTM or BERT (for more advanced models)

Model Evaluation

Use metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Perform cross-validation to ensure stability

Visualization

Word Clouds for positive/negative words

Bar graphs showing sentiment distribution

Time-series plot to show sentiment trend over time

Deployment (Optional)

Build a simple Streamlit or Flask web app

User enters a product review ‚Üí Model returns sentiment

üìà Expected Outcomes:

Accurately classify sentiments of product reviews

Identify top positive/negative features of products

Provide real-time sentiment scoring in a dashboard or web app

üí° Future Enhancements:

Add multilingual review support

Detect sarcasm using advanced models like BERT

Summarize customer reviews with extractive summarization
