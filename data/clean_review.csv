"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead,"  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.",Neutral

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Decent overall package for an entry level phone,"  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks",Positive

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram.

I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day❗Moral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier 🙏",Extremely Negative

All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.",Extremely Negative

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",A fab phone at this price!,"  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍",Extremely Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",My Real Review - M31 is Average,"  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.",Positive

If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device.

So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5.

Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better.

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Best in class, but with a few exceptions","  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?",Neutral

For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP.

"Redmi Note 9 (Pebble Grey, 4GB RAM 64GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",🙄Redmi changed lifestyle😎🤭🤷‍♂️,"  I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.",Extremely Positive

The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it.

"Redmi Note 9 (Pebble Grey, 4GB RAM 64GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Sensors problems,"  I'm aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I'm personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I've got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I've tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it's not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?",Extremely Negative

"Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9.

"Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Decent overall package for an entry level phone,"  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks",Positive

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.",Extremely Positive

It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.,Extremely Negative

"Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers",Very good smart phone,"  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.",Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers",Go for any phone but not this if u don't want to regret wasting ur money,  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.,Extremely Negative

"Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers",Definitely Best choice at the Price from SAMSUNG,"  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.",Positive

However, charging with the in-box charger is very slow.Camera - The camera isn't bad but it isn't something to boast about. It does fairly well in bright sunlight conditions and not so well in dark conditions wherein the pictures are blurry and full of grains.Screen - The screen is pleasantly bright and legible. Good colour balance and vibrance. However, the touch, at times, feels laggy. Rarely even bordering on non-functional.Performance - Performance is as is expected from a phone in this price range, not very good but not shabby either.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",The best phone money can buy at this price,"  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Yeah...it's best in this budget...,"  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Samsung phones have signal strength issues,"  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Nice phone with a bad processor,"  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Honest Review of Samsung galaxy m21.,"  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Amazing, definitely!","  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Excellent call quality and network reception,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",One of the best phone for normal users !,"  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!",Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Wise Choice of an ""All Rounder"" Smartphone - Heartful review - Vera Level Phone","  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon't charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon ""Buy Now"" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET EARTH,"  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.",Extremely Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Good camera, better battery life, best display & doesn't lag","  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   CAMERAThe camera setup takes fine pictures in both natural and artificial lighting conditions. The 48MP sensor does take sharper images but lacks advanced HDR although in 16MP mode HDR works great. On zooming it doesnot take decent shots, just oversharpen the images and bumping the contrast. The wide angle 128° is awesome with wide dynamic range the pics are excellent although this lens struggles in moderate to low light scenarios.This phone takes decent videos all the way upto UHD 4K. The video stabilization is phenomenal. Although when using super steady mode you can't use wideangle or zoom lens and also it crops in a bit but overall a solid camera. The 20MP front camera takes average selfie but great videos. Also night mode is a fraud. Night mode doesn't work.DISPLAYThe super amoled display alone is the reason why I'll recommend this phone to everyone. It's stunning, colour accurate, sharp & crisp, and also emit less blue light so gentle on eye too.SOFTWAREAndroid 10.0 operating system with one UI 2.0 is fast & fluid and it stays like that. It doesn't lag now and it doesn't lag in future. The one UI skin is extreamly functional and fluid. IT DOESN'T LAG. It comes with loads of pre-installed apps but 90% of them can be manually uninstalled or disabled so no big deal. Timely monthly updates and one major OS update. KNOX is not there in this phone but thats fine in general samsung software is one of the secure software in android realm.PERFORMANCEThe exynos processor is somewhat comparable to snapdragon 660 and handles games and everyday tasks with breeze. Although sometimes framerates fluctuates in heavy games like call of duty and similar games. But for 95% of the times this processor will excel at whatever you throw at it.BATTERYThe battery life is great. I'm having about 8-9 hrs screen on time with auto brightness on and mobile data on all the time with moderate usage and some games & navigation along the way. 15w fast charging takes about 2.5-3 hrs to charge it up.MISCELLANEOUSThe fingerprint reader works fast & fine. Bottom speaker is not too loud but sound doesn't crack in high volume. The earpiece is adequately clear and audible. The build quality is excellent too having no flex. The USB-C port is nice upgrade. With 0.468W/Kg SAR Value it's very safe phone radiation wise.",Positive

Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices.

The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review,Neutral

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate",Pathetic customer support,"  I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.",Extremely Negative

Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents.",Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate","Got more than expected, at this price point.","  Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost. Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered. Happy shopping.",Extremely Positive

Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate",Awesome phone,"  Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 6.5-inch HD+ Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution. The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset.",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",Fair deal by brand samsung,"  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",3.5 star. Good enough.,"  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most.

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",Fair deal by brand samsung,"  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",3.5 star. Good enough.,"  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone.

I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it.

You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review,Neutral

Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.",Extremely Negative

Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents.",Positive

It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videosCons: though Super AMOLED Infinity-U 6.6” display gives a true-to-life to mobile, indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one.

Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S.

Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x.

The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games.

No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.

You will have to learn how to use quad cameras properly via youtube videos.4) When you enable FingerPrint, Password lock, then Google backup stops working. This is major issue in this phone.5) The local MIUI backup for call history, sms history  doesn't work at all and it fails continuously. I showed it to the MI retailer shop and also to the customer care, even after 2 factory resets, this feature doesn't work. The only way to backup call history, sms history is via Google backup. But for google backup to work you have to disable Fingerprint lock. So, overall a bad backup experience in the current MIUI 12.0.6.06) Comes with lots of un-removable MIUI bloatware. I removed them manually via XDA tool on PC, apps like MiPay, MiCloud, Wellbeing, Mi Credit, Facebook, etc. A non-technical user or elders will have to live with all the bloatware of MIUI which shares your personal data with external applications by default.

I am from sales background and pure need of mobile for calling and switching multiple apps. I have been using Samsung J7 Prime from 5 years and still that is going good. But today's generation boys make me feel my mobile is old and internet speed isn't great because of old device and neeneed to look for new mobile. And I asked to go for this redmi. I was 90% sure I will go with Samsung again but they made me to belive Redmi is better than Samsung.Now the story begin. It's absolutely scrap. Redmi might compete with anyone but they aren't great. My internet speed remain same as I use to have on years old Samsung. Samsung nevers hangs in 5 years, but this mobile hangs frequently. I m irked customer of Nokia which troubled me after 1 year use  but this mobile irk just after 20 days.Photo quality I beluve J7 5 year old mobile camera us equally good than this 48 mp camera.Connecting headphone is headache.

After hard argument they suggest to contact Redmi service center. On the name of Replacement it's trap. But it at your risk.Don't get trab of young generation promoting redmi to buy because only if camera.

"Redmi 9 Power (Mighty Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 6000mAh Battery |FHD+ Screen| 48MP Quad Camera | Snapdragon 662 Processor",Not for power users,"  It's a good phone with horrible software. Here are some fixes.1. Ads - use Blockada to block all MIUI ads and trackers. This is free and does NOT require root. As a personal preference I also use the Nova Launcher to make the phone's UI look more polished and close to stock Android.2. Phone recording - This is an absolutely stupid inconvenience that Xiaomi shoved into their phones which nobody asked for. This phone uses Goggle Dialer meaning you can NOT discreetly record all your calls and the phone will play an alert saying This call is being recorded'. In my opinion, this is the worst thing about this phone because it is unfixable without rooting it. Every other xiaomi phone lets you use the miui dialer with the built-in discreet automatic call recorder. NOT THIS ONE. I hate this and hope xiaomi fixes this with a software update.3. Camera quality: It's not bad, it's actually pretty good for the price. But you can get way better photos by using the G-Cam APK. Google 'Gcam for Redmi 9 Power'. At the time of writing, the gcam port does not support video.Other annoying things that can't be fixed via software:1. Lack of LED light2. Imbalanced speakers. The bottom speaker is way more powerful than the top, this makes the stereo effect super annoying, even though a lot of paid YouTubers would have touted it as a feature. It gets annoying unless you're holing it in a way that amplifies the top speaker. This can be mitigated a little by messing with the equalizer, but that sounds like too much work unless you're willing to mess with it every time you plug in your headphones.3. My screen protector came pre-applied, but it was off-center. My eyes have gotten used to it, but that was a horrible first impression.4. It's made by a Chinese company.Positives:1. Nice bang-for the buck.2. Great in-hand feel3. Long-lasting battery4. Has IR blaster which is handy sometimesNeutrals1. The Redmi logo is big, but it's hardly visible. I can only see it under a specific light. Otherwise it's fine. I'd prefer if they were more classy about it along with being subtle.I can't recommend this phone to most people because of the voice recording / google dailer mess. Otherwise this would have been a good phone. I don't regret buying it, but it doesn't make me happy that i bought it.",Negative

It easy survived for more than 40 hours after using some basic apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Prime Video and Spotify.Software:--The UI seems good, except some apps which keeps crashing every time. (Requires a software update to avoid that)--Experienced no Lag when switching between apps or while using apps.Over all this is a good device at this price range. Definitely not recommended if you use many apps and install heavy games, as many apps crash while using. Can gift it to parents who doesn't use many apps or can be used as a secondary mobile phone.",Positive

I just can't believe that I got this phone at such a great price. 48 MP Quad cam setup is extremely powerful to get those crystal clear photos with sharp quality. 6000 mAh battery literally stays for 1-2 days even after extreme usage and 2-3 if we use only for calling and WhatsApp and with the 18W charger in the box is amazing as it just takes much less time compared to its battery lifespan. The speakers are much louder and sound like a home theater. The processor is awesome for gaming on medium graphics and good for high graphics for sometime. The gorilla glass is literally hard like a gorilla because I just mistakely dropped my phone 1-2 times from a human height without case and screen guard then too not a single scratch appeared. This display and screen is also too good.Conclusion -: If you want to buy a awesome phone with a decent and good gaming processor in budget then must go for it.,Extremely Positive

On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product.

But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9.

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Decent overall package for an entry level phone,"  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks",Positive

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Redmi 9 review.,"  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.",Extremely Positive

I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly.

"Redmi 9A (Nature Green, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) | 2GHz Octa-core Helio G25 Processor | 5000 mAh Battery","Durable phone, worth every single rupee!","  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone.

I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5.

It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.",Positive

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex,Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Net work speed very slow also charging not like fast charging,  Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time .

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",HONEST REVIEW BY USER,"  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device.

Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better.

Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin.

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it,"  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.Edit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white.

Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well.

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Best in class, but with a few exceptions","  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?",Neutral

For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP.

Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.",Extremely Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31,"  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.",Extremely Negative
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Samsung make fool to their customers in the name of warranty,  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....,Extremely Negative

My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation.

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance,"  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).

On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Positive

But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9.

Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.mobile display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.

"Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor",Decent overall package for an entry level phone,"  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks",Positive

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.",Extremely Positive

Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.,Negative
"Redmi Note 9 (Pebble Grey, 4GB RAM 64GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",🙄Redmi changed lifestyle😎🤭🤷‍♂️,"  I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.",Extremely Positive

What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance.

"Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers",Definitely Best choice at the Price from SAMSUNG,"  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.",Positive

It does fairly well in bright sunlight conditions and not so well in dark conditions wherein the pictures are blurry and full of grains.Screen - The screen is pleasantly bright and legible. Good colour balance and vibrance. However, the touch, at times, feels laggy.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",The best phone money can buy at this price,"  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Yeah...it's best in this budget...,"  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t.

I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Nice phone with a bad processor,"  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved",Neutral

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Honest Review of Samsung galaxy m21.,"  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Amazing, definitely!","  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k.

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",Excellent call quality and network reception,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",One of the best phone for normal users !,"  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!",Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET EARTH,"  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.",Extremely Positive
"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Good camera, better battery life, best display & doesn't lag","  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   CAMERAThe camera setup takes fine pictures in both natural and artificial lighting conditions. The 48MP sensor does take sharper images but lacks advanced HDR although in 16MP mode HDR works great. On zooming it doesnot take decent shots, just oversharpen the images and bumping the contrast. The wide angle 128° is awesome with wide dynamic range the pics are excellent although this lens struggles in moderate to low light scenarios.This phone takes decent videos all the way upto UHD 4K. The video stabilization is phenomenal. Although when using super steady mode you can't use wideangle or zoom lens and also it crops in a bit but overall a solid camera. The 20MP front camera takes average selfie but great videos. Also night mode is a fraud. Night mode doesn't work.DISPLAYThe super amoled display alone is the reason why I'll recommend this phone to everyone. It's stunning, colour accurate, sharp & crisp, and also emit less blue light so gentle on eye too.SOFTWAREAndroid 10.0 operating system with one UI 2.0 is fast & fluid and it stays like that. It doesn't lag now and it doesn't lag in future. The one UI skin is extreamly functional and fluid. IT DOESN'T LAG. It comes with loads of pre-installed apps but 90% of them can be manually uninstalled or disabled so no big deal. Timely monthly updates and one major OS update. KNOX is not there in this phone but thats fine in general samsung software is one of the secure software in android realm.PERFORMANCEThe exynos processor is somewhat comparable to snapdragon 660 and handles games and everyday tasks with breeze. Although sometimes framerates fluctuates in heavy games like call of duty and similar games. But for 95% of the times this processor will excel at whatever you throw at it.BATTERYThe battery life is great. I'm having about 8-9 hrs screen on time with auto brightness on and mobile data on all the time with moderate usage and some games & navigation along the way. 15w fast charging takes about 2.5-3 hrs to charge it up.MISCELLANEOUSThe fingerprint reader works fast & fine. Bottom speaker is not too loud but sound doesn't crack in high volume. The earpiece is adequately clear and audible. The build quality is excellent too having no flex. The USB-C port is nice upgrade. With 0.468W/Kg SAR Value it's very safe phone radiation wise.",Positive

Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information.",Extremely Negative

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate",Good battery but average performance,  Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review,Neutral

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate",Pathetic customer support,"  I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.",Extremely Negative

Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents.",Positive

Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) 6000 mAh with 8nm Processor | True 48 MP Quad Camera | 90Hz Refresh Rate",Awesome phone,"  Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 6.5-inch HD+ Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution. The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset.",Extremely Positive

It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK.

The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone",Neutral

While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale.",Extremely Negative

No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.

"Redmi 9 Power (Mighty Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 6000mAh Battery |FHD+ Screen| 48MP Quad Camera | Snapdragon 662 Processor",Overall a budget phone with lots of bloatware,"  Using this phone since a month and some of the key features are missing and facing other issues with MIUI12.Pros:  1)Good battery backup, but charging from 95% to 100% will take longer in the end.  2)Non-slippery and sturdy build quality  3)Comes with pre-applied screen guard which is still working fine.  4)Good sound qualityCons:  1)There is no Notification light, when you are charging there is no indication that it is even charging or fully charged.2) There is no notification light for any alerts which you receive, when you keep the phone for charging or when you receive any sms, missed calls, etc. You will have to unlock the phone and check the notifications.3) The camera quality is OK. You will have to learn how to use quad cameras properly via youtube videos.4) When you enable FingerPrint, Password lock, then Google backup stops working. This is major issue in this phone.5) The local MIUI backup for call history, sms history  doesn't work at all and it fails continuously. I showed it to the MI retailer shop and also to the customer care, even after 2 factory resets, this feature doesn't work. The only way to backup call history, sms history is via Google backup. But for google backup to work you have to disable Fingerprint lock. So, overall a bad backup experience in the current MIUI 12.0.6.06) Comes with lots of un-removable MIUI bloatware. I removed them manually via XDA tool on PC, apps like MiPay, MiCloud, Wellbeing, Mi Credit, Facebook, etc. A non-technical user or elders will have to live with all the bloatware of MIUI which shares your personal data with external applications by default. Better to watch some tips and tricks online and disable them.",Positive
"Redmi 9 Power (Mighty Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 6000mAh Battery |FHD+ Screen| 48MP Quad Camera | Snapdragon 662 Processor",Usless apps promotion and keep hanging,"  Worst than Nokia and Microsoft mobile. I am from sales background and pure need of mobile for calling and switching multiple apps. I have been using Samsung J7 Prime from 5 years and still that is going good. But today's generation boys make me feel my mobile is old and internet speed isn't great because of old device and neeneed to look for new mobile. And I asked to go for this redmi. I was 90% sure I will go with Samsung again but they made me to belive Redmi is better than Samsung.Now the story begin. It's absolutely scrap. Redmi might compete with anyone but they aren't great. My internet speed remain same as I use to have on years old Samsung. Samsung nevers hangs in 5 years, but this mobile hangs frequently. I m irked customer of Nokia which troubled me after 1 year use  but this mobile irk just after 20 days.Photo quality I beluve J7 5 year old mobile camera us equally good than this 48 mp camera.Connecting headphone is headache. I have 2-3 google meet a day, now I always connnect with Laptop as this mobile burn my fingure to connect hard or to stress hard to keep connecting headphones.The day received I have trouble but Amazon denied to replace or return back saying this mobile is perfectly ok just by installing a app on your mobile and fool you to belive mobile is ok. After hard argument they suggest to contact Redmi service center. On the name of Replacement it's trap. But it at your risk.Don't get trab of young generation promoting redmi to buy because only if camera. Choice is yours, you buy it's for calls or camera.Lastly this mobile keep on promoting to download all useless app like play rummi, moz, chat share many many more. It's already have plenty of useless and harmfull preloaded apps. I dosent understand is this Redmi owned by single management. Everday same usless apps are recommend to download again and again. It's junk box. Good buys to redmi forever and byby to Amazo  for never I will buy mobile on Amazon.",Negative

"Redmi 9 Power (Mighty Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 6000mAh Battery |FHD+ Screen| 48MP Quad Camera | Snapdragon 662 Processor",Not for power users,"  It's a good phone with horrible software. Here are some fixes.1. Ads - use Blockada to block all MIUI ads and trackers. This is free and does NOT require root. As a personal preference I also use the Nova Launcher to make the phone's UI look more polished and close to stock Android.2. Phone recording - This is an absolutely stupid inconvenience that Xiaomi shoved into their phones which nobody asked for. This phone uses Goggle Dialer meaning you can NOT discreetly record all your calls and the phone will play an alert saying This call is being recorded'. In my opinion, this is the worst thing about this phone because it is unfixable without rooting it. Every other xiaomi phone lets you use the miui dialer with the built-in discreet automatic call recorder. NOT THIS ONE. I hate this and hope xiaomi fixes this with a software update.3. Camera quality: It's not bad, it's actually pretty good for the price. But you can get way better photos by using the G-Cam APK. Google 'Gcam for Redmi 9 Power'. At the time of writing, the gcam port does not support video.Other annoying things that can't be fixed via software:1. Lack of LED light2. Imbalanced speakers. The bottom speaker is way more powerful than the top, this makes the stereo effect super annoying, even though a lot of paid YouTubers would have touted it as a feature. It gets annoying unless you're holing it in a way that amplifies the top speaker. This can be mitigated a little by messing with the equalizer, but that sounds like too much work unless you're willing to mess with it every time you plug in your headphones.3. My screen protector came pre-applied, but it was off-center. My eyes have gotten used to it, but that was a horrible first impression.4. It's made by a Chinese company.Positives:1. Nice bang-for the buck.2. Great in-hand feel3. Long-lasting battery4. Has IR blaster which is handy sometimesNeutrals1. The Redmi logo is big, but it's hardly visible. I can only see it under a specific light. Otherwise it's fine. I'd prefer if they were more classy about it along with being subtle.I can't recommend this phone to most people because of the voice recording / google dailer mess. Otherwise this would have been a good phone. I don't regret buying it, but it doesn't make me happy that i bought it.",Negative

It easy survived for more than 40 hours after using some basic apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Prime Video and Spotify.Software:--The UI seems good, except some apps which keeps crashing every time. (Requires a software update to avoid that)--Experienced no Lag when switching between apps or while using apps.Over all this is a good device at this price range.

The speakers are much louder and sound like a home theater. The processor is awesome for gaming on medium graphics and good for high graphics for sometime.

Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",3.5 star. Good enough.,"  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use.

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",Fair deal by brand samsung,"  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍",Extremely Positive

"Samsung Galaxy M02 (Black,3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",3.5 star. Good enough.,"  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there.

No silicon cover.I purchased for my son. Initially it will be used for zoom meeting and games.
